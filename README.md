## Project Overview

This project aims to identify **rotten fruits** using **image recognition** techniques. The goal 
is to classify fruit images into categories such as fresh and rotten. This can have real-world 
applications in industries like agriculture and retail, where identifying spoiled produce efficiently 
is important.

---

## Features:
- Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.
- Uses transfer learning to improve model accuracy.
- Data preprocessing includes image augmentation (rotation, scaling, etc.) to improve model robustness.
- Model is trained and tested on a dataset of various fruits in both fresh and rotten conditions.
- Built with Pytorch.

## Project Structure

- **data/fruits**: Contains the training and testing datasets of fruits (fresh and rotten).
  - `train/`: Training images, labeled as fresh or rotten followed by the fruit name.
  - `valid/`: Test images for evaluation, same format as the training images.

- **models/**: Pre-trained models saved after training.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and initial model prototyping.

- **src/**: Source code directory.
  - `utils.py`: Helper functions for the project.

- **README.md**: Documentation file (you‚Äôre reading it now!).
